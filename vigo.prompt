let $x="Vigo,Spain" Using only html and JavaScript provide the code for the following.create an array called $xplaces of top ten attractions in $x including lat,long co-ordinates. For $xplaces calculate distance between successive elements and re-sort $xplaces based on distance between elements. 

For element 0 of $xplaces display on an openstreetmap map on a single html page a label and marker at the lat,long co-ordinates of element 0. When I click on the marker for element 0 of $xplaces it displays on the map  for element 1 of $xplaces a marker at the lat,long co-ordinates of element 1. The label for element 1 should also show the description and distance in miles between elements 0 and 1 of $xplaces,and all other markers and labels should be removed except for those for the current and previous elements of $xplaces, in this case, elements 1 and 0 of $xplaces. Repeat this for all elements of $xplaces
