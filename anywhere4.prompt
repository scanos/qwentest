wait until $mygps has valid GPS co-ordinates then using nominitam or another gazetteer determine the descriptions of the nearest 8 gazetteer place-entries and nodes within 1 mile of $mygps based on their GPS coordinates and show them on a html table including the tag, description and distance from $mygps
