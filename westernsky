**Way Beyond the Western Sky**

*Verse 1*  
I chased your shadow 'cross the open plain,  
Where the sun would burn and the heart would strain.  
Your laughter lingered in the evening glow,  
But now it’s just a memory, soft and low.  

*Pre-Chorus*  
Every star above reminds me of your eyes,  
Fading in the distance, way beyond the western sky.  

*Chorus*  
Way beyond the western sky, where the dreams we had don’t die,  
I’m reaching out, but you’re too far to hold.  
Your love’s a ghost in the twilight’s sigh,  
Lost somewhere beyond the western sky,  
And my heart’s still breaking, out here in the cold.  

*Verse 2*  
We carved our names in the cottonwood tree,  
Swore forever, just you and me.  
But the winds of time, they tore us apart,  
Left me with the echo of a wandering heart.  

*Pre-Chorus*  
Every sunset burns, it cuts me like a knife,  
Carrying your memory, way beyond the western sky.  

*Chorus*  
Way beyond the western sky, where the dreams we had don’t die,  
I’m reaching out, but you’re too far to hold.  
Your love’s a ghost in the twilight’s sigh,  
Lost somewhere beyond the western sky,  
And my heart’s still breaking, out here in the cold.  

*Bridge*  
I walk these plains where the wild winds moan,  
Searching for a love I’ll never own.  
The horizon calls, but it’s bittersweet,  
Your footsteps fade where the heavens meet.  

*Chorus*  
Way beyond the western sky, where the dreams we had don’t die,  
I’m reaching out, but you’re too far to hold.  
Your love’s a ghost in the twilight’s sigh,  
Lost somewhere beyond the western sky,  
And my heart’s still breaking, out here in the cold.  

*Outro*  
So I’ll sing your name to the endless night,  
Hoping somehow you’ll hear me in the light.  
Way beyond the western sky, my love,  
I’ll wait for you till the stars above.
