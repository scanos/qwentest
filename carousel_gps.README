carousel_gps.html

This extracts gps data from 4 images and plots them on a google map
You need to change the Google api key in google web site
I had to download and add exif.js manually 
I had to enable add gps data on my mobile phone

The Chatgpt prompt is 
 Create a html page 
Create a html table and for each of the images "h1.jpg,h2.jpg,h3.jpg,h4.jpg" 
create a table row with one cell displaying the image name, display a thumbnail of the image in the second cell, and the third cell displaying the geolocation metadata of each image 
using exif.js which been installed in the same folder.

After the table has been completed, create a google map which should be loaded async mode, 
and centered on Beirut, Lebanon, at zoom 15 and map type ROADMAP, 
and create markers on the map for each of the images "h1.jpg,h2.jpg,h3.jpg,h4.jpg"  based on their geolocation data 

For future reference I'm going to use a csv file with the geodata of each image pre-calculated
