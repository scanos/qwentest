let $x="Vigo,Spain" let $element = 0 .Using only html and JavaScript provide the code for the following.create an array called $xplaces of top ten attractions in $x including lat,long co-ordinates. for each element in $xplaces , except the last element, calculate the distance between the current element and the next element. Store the calculated distances in $xplaces as nextdistance and re-sort $xplaces on nextdistance.Also, for each element in $xplaces calculate the distance between the current element lat long co-ordinates and the centre of $x lat long co-ordinates and also store this in $xplaces as centredistance.

For element $element of $xplaces, display on an openstreetmap map on a single html page a label and marker at the lat,long co-ordinates of element $element. Show nextdistance and centredistance on the label for element $element. When the marker for element $element of $xplaces is clicked  it displays on the map  for element $element+1 of $xplaces a marker at the lat,long co-ordinates of element $element+1 . 

The label for element $element+1 should also show the description and nextdistance in miles and centredistance in miles , and all other markers and labels should be removed except for those for elements $element and $element+1 of $xplaces, increment $element by 1 and repeat this for all elements of $xplaces
