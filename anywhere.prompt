Using only html and JavaScript provide the code for the following.create an array called $xplaces of top ten attractions nearest to my location including lat,long co-ordinates. for each element in $xplaces calculate the distance between the current element and the next element, except the last element. Store the calculated distances in $xplaces re-sort $xplaces on distance.

Display on an openstreetmap map on a single html page a label and marker at the lat,long co-ordinates of my current location and the marker and label for the element in $xplaces which is closest to my location based on the lat long co-ordinates for that element.The label for the element should should show the distance between the element and my location.

When I click on the marker for my location it should redraw the marker and label for my new location based on the lat long coordinates of my new location and search $xplaces and draw a marker and label (showing miles from my current location) at the lat long coordinates for the element in $xplaces
